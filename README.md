# Database Fundamentals and SQL Overview

Welcome to the Database and SQL overview guide. This README provides a basic understanding of key database concepts, focusing on Database Management Systems (DBMS), Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), and Structured Query Language (SQL).

## What is a Database?

A **Database** is a collection of interrelated data, organized in a manner that allows for easy access, management, and updating.

## What is DBMS?

**DBMS (Database Management System)** is software designed to create, manage, and organize databases. It acts as an interface between the database and its users or application programs, ensuring that the data is consistently organized and remains easily accessible.

## What is RDBMS?

**RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)** is a type of DBMS that organizes data into tables (also called relations). Here’s how an RDBMS works:
- Data is stored in tables consisting of rows (records) and columns (attributes).
- Each table can have relationships with other tables, which helps in maintaining data integrity and reducing redundancy.

Examples of RDBMS include:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle Database

## What is SQL?

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the standard language used to interact with RDBMS. It allows you to store, manipulate, and retrieve data efficiently. It’s important to note that SQL is a language, not a database.

### SQL for CRUD Operations

SQL is used for performing CRUD operations, which stands for:
- **CREATE**: To create databases, tables, and insert data into tables.
- **READ**: To retrieve or read data from the database.
- **UPDATE**: To modify existing data in the database.
- **DELETE**: To delete databases, tables, or specific data points (rows).

**Note**: SQL keywords are NOT case-sensitive. For example, `SELECT` is the same as `select` in SQL.
